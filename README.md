  </a>
</p>

<br/>

## Introduction

This is a hybrid Next.js + Python app that uses Next.js as the frontend and Flask as the API backend. I chose this tech stack in order to make Python calls on the backend to specific API hosts that I believed were the best fit for this project.

## How It Works

This site is designed with ease of use in mind! Simply visit the home page, drag or click to upload your photo, and hit Analyze to get results on your photo.
The AI model will detect food items in your photo and even provide some recipe suggestions using the items you have in your fridge. It's a two button process!
